Create a well-crafted commit from current changes.

## Workflow

1. **Check for changes**
   - `git status --porcelain=v1`
   - If empty → report "Nothing to commit" and stop

2. **Analyze and stage changes**
   - `git status --porcelain=v1` - Get list of changed files
   - Review each file - skip if matches: `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `credentials*`, `secrets*`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.next/`, `*.log`
   - Stage specific files: `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
   - If all files were skipped → report "No safe files to commit" and stop

3. **Review staged changes**
   - `git diff --cached --name-only` - List changed files
   - `git diff --cached` - Review actual changes

4. **Compose commit message**
   - Format: `<type>: <summary>`
   - Types: `feat` | `fix` | `refactor` | `chore` | `docs` | `test`
   - Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
   - Max 72 characters
   - No trailing period
   - Optional body: 2-5 bullets for complex changes

5. **Create commit**
   - `git commit -m "<subject>"` (add `-m "<body>"` if needed)

## Commit Type Guide

| Type | Use When |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `chore` | Build, config, dependencies |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |

## Output Format

**Success:**
```
COMMIT BOT REPORT

SUCCESS: Created commit
Hash: [short hash]
Message: [commit subject]
Files: [list of changed files]
```

**Nothing to commit:**
```
COMMIT BOT REPORT

SUCCESS: Nothing to commit - working tree clean
```

**Failure:**
```
COMMIT BOT REPORT

FAILURE: [step] failed
Error: [relevant output]
```

## Rules

- Use only git commands
- Commit stays local (no push)
- Do not include co-author attribution
- Do not enumerate test names in body
- Analyze changes to choose appropriate type
- Never stage files matching sensitive patterns (.env*, credentials*, secrets*, *.key, *.pem)
