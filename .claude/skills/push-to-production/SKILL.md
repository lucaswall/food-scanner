Promote `main` to `release` with automated backup, migration assessment, and merge. This is the only path to production.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

### 1.1 Verify Linear MCP

Call `mcp__linear__list_teams`. If unavailable, **STOP** and tell the user: "Linear MCP is not connected. Run `/mcp` to reconnect, then re-run this skill."

### 1.2 Git State

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --porcelain
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be on `main` branch
- Working tree must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Must be up to date with remote: `git fetch origin && git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` must be `0`

If any check fails, **STOP** and tell the user what to fix.

### 1.3 Docker (OrbStack)

Ensure OrbStack and Docker are available for migration validation:

```bash
orb status
```

- If **Running**: proceed
- If **Stopped**: start it with `orb start`, then verify with `docker compose ps`
- If `orb` command not found: **STOP** — "OrbStack is not installed. Install with `brew install orbstack`."

Then ensure local Postgres is running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

If the `db` service is not running, start it: `docker compose up -d`

### 1.4 Verify Drizzle Migration Internals

Only needed if MIGRATIONS.md has entries (checked in Phase 2, but verify early to fail fast). Read the Drizzle migrator source from the exact version in `node_modules` and confirm our assumptions about the journal table still hold:

```bash
# Check migrator comparison logic
grep -q '"drizzle"."__drizzle_migrations"' node_modules/drizzle-orm/pg-proxy/migrator.js
grep -q 'ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1' node_modules/drizzle-orm/pg-proxy/migrator.js
grep -q 'created_at' node_modules/drizzle-orm/pg-proxy/migrator.js

# Check hash algorithm
grep -q 'createHash("sha256")' node_modules/drizzle-orm/migrator.js
```

All four must match. If any fails, **STOP**: "Drizzle migration internals have changed since this skill was written. The journal insert approach may not work. Check `node_modules/drizzle-orm/pg-proxy/migrator.js` manually and update the skill."

This verification is safe because we deploy the same `node_modules` — the code we check here is the code that will run in production.

### 1.5 Build & Tests

Run the `verifier` agent (full mode) to confirm unit tests, lint, and build pass:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type "verifier"
```

If verifier reports failures, **STOP**. Do not proceed with a broken build.

### 1.6 E2E Tests

Run the `verifier` agent in E2E mode to confirm end-to-end tests pass:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type "verifier" with prompt "e2e"
```

Docker/OrbStack is already verified in Phase 1.3, so prerequisites are met.

If E2E tests fail, **STOP**. Do not proceed — E2E failures indicate integration issues that must be fixed before release.

### 1.7 Release Branch Exists

```bash
git rev-parse --verify origin/release
```

If `release` branch doesn't exist, **STOP** and tell the user to create it.

### 1.8 Diff Assessment

Check what's changing between `release` and `main`:

```bash
git log origin/release..origin/main --oneline
git diff origin/release..origin/main --stat
```

If there are no commits to promote, **STOP**: "Nothing to promote. `main` and `release` are identical."

Show the user the commit list and file diff summary.

## Phase 2: Assess Migrations

Migration assessment runs before backup so we know whether to stop the service first.

### 2.1 Read MIGRATIONS.md

Read `MIGRATIONS.md` from project root.

If `MIGRATIONS.md` has no entries (only the template header), skip to Phase 4 (backup without stopping service, then merge).

### 2.2 Analyze Changes

For each entry in MIGRATIONS.md:

1. **Read the referenced files** on `main` to understand the current (new) state
2. **Compare with `release`** to understand what production currently has:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/release..HEAD -- <relevant-files>
   ```
3. **Determine the net migration** — what SQL or data transformation is needed to go from production's current state to the new state

### 2.3 Classify Migration Complexity

Classify **each MIGRATIONS.md entry independently**. A single release may have entries at different levels.

| Complexity | Criteria | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **None** | No data affected (new tables only, new columns with defaults) | Skip — Drizzle handles DDL |
| **Data-only** | Drizzle handles DDL, but a standalone data operation is also needed (cleanup, backfill nullable column, one-time DELETE/UPDATE) | Collect SQL → run against production in Phase 5.1 |
| **Simple** | DDL changes that Drizzle can't handle alone (column renames, type changes, backfill + NOT NULL constraint) | Write full migration script with Drizzle journal inserts (Phase 3) |
| **Complex** | Data transformation logic, ambiguous mappings, potential data loss | **STOP** and discuss with user |

**Key distinction:** "Data-only" means Drizzle's generated migrations are sufficient for the schema changes — the extra SQL is a data operation that runs *after* Drizzle migrations complete at deploy startup. "Simple" means the DDL itself needs manual handling (Drizzle's generated SQL would fail or produce wrong results on existing data).

### 2.4 Handle Data-only Migrations

For entries classified as Data-only:

1. Write the SQL statements to a file at `_migrations/data-YYYYMMDD.sql`
2. Use data-agnostic SQL (derive values from existing DB content, never hardcode user data)
3. These will be executed against production in Phase 5.1 **after** the deploy completes and Drizzle migrations run

### 2.5 Handle Complex Migrations

If any migration is classified as Complex:

1. Present the issue to the user:
   ```
   ## Migration Requires Discussion

   **Entry:** [MIGRATIONS.md entry]
   **Problem:** [why it's complex]
   **Options:**
   1. [Option A with trade-offs]
   2. [Option B with trade-offs]
   3. Skip this migration (manual intervention needed post-deploy)

   What would you like to do?
   ```

2. Wait for user input before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Write & Validate Migration

Only applies if Phase 2 found migrations to execute.

### 3.1 Identify Covered Drizzle Migrations

Check which Drizzle migration files (in `drizzle/`) are new since `release`:

```bash
git diff origin/release..HEAD --name-only -- drizzle/
```

Read the SQL content of each new Drizzle migration file. The manual migration script must cover **all DDL and data changes** so these Drizzle files don't need to run again. After the manual script executes, we mark these migrations as applied in Drizzle's journal table.

### 3.2 Write Migration SQL

Create a migration file at `_migrations/release-YYYYMMDD.sql` with:
- Transaction wrapper (`BEGIN; ... COMMIT;`)
- **All DDL changes** from the covered Drizzle migration files (use safe idioms: `IF NOT EXISTS`, nullable-then-backfill-then-NOT-NULL)
- **All data transformations** from MIGRATIONS.md entries
- **Drizzle journal inserts** to mark covered migrations as applied
- Comments explaining each operation

**PRIVACY RULE: Never hardcode user data in migration SQL.** The migration file lives in gitignored `_migrations/`, but always write data-agnostic SQL that derives values from existing database content (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT email FROM sessions`) rather than hardcoding emails, names, or other personal data. This makes the migration work for any data state and avoids accidental leaks.

**Drizzle journal compatibility.** Drizzle decides which migrations to run by checking the `created_at` of the **most recent** row in `"drizzle"."__drizzle_migrations"` and running all migrations with a `when` timestamp (from `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`) greater than that value. The manual script must insert journal rows so Drizzle skips the covered migrations at deploy startup. These internals are verified in Phase 1.4 against the exact `node_modules` code that will run in production.

**Journal table details:**
- Schema-qualified: `"drizzle"."__drizzle_migrations"` (NOT `public`)
- Columns: `id` serial PK, `hash` text NOT NULL, `created_at` numeric
- `hash` = SHA-256 hex of the SQL file contents: `shasum -a 256 drizzle/XXXX.sql | cut -d' ' -f1`
- `created_at` = the `when` value from the corresponding entry in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` (epoch milliseconds)

**Important:** Drizzle only compares `created_at` timestamps, not hashes, to decide what to run. But always insert correct hashes for integrity.

For a full example migration script, read [references/migration-example.md](references/migration-example.md).

### 3.3 Validate Against Backup

Restore the production backup to a local test database and run the migration:

1. Restore backup:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS migration_test;"
   docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE migration_test;"
   /opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin/pg_restore \
     --dbname="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/migration_test" \
     --no-owner --no-privileges \
     _migrations/backup-*.dump
   ```

2. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   /opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin/psql \
     "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/migration_test" \
     -f _migrations/release-YYYYMMDD.sql
   ```

3. Verify the migration succeeded (no errors)

4. Verify Drizzle journal entries were inserted:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d migration_test \
     -c "SELECT id, hash, created_at FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations ORDER BY id;"
   ```
   Confirm the new entries appear for the covered migrations with correct `created_at` values matching `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`.

5. Clean up:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE migration_test;"
   ```

If local Docker is not available, show the migration SQL to the user and ask for manual approval.

### 3.4 Show Migration to User

Regardless of validation, display the full migration SQL to the user for review:

```
## Migration SQL (will be applied to production)

[SQL content]

Validated against production backup: [yes/no]
Drizzle journal entries: [list of covered migration files]
Proceed with release?
```

Wait for user confirmation.

## Phase 4: Backup Production Database

### 4.1 Create Backup Directory

```bash
mkdir -p _migrations
```

### 4.2 Get Production Database URL

```bash
railway run -e production -s food-scanner printenv DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL
```

If the command fails or returns empty, **STOP**: "Cannot connect to production database. Check Railway configuration and DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL variable."

### 4.3 Stop Production Service (if migration needed)

If migration SQL was written in Phase 3, stop the production app service **before** taking the backup. This ensures the backup captures every last write — no data can be lost between backup and migration.

```bash
railway down -y -e production -s food-scanner
```

If the command fails, **STOP**: "Cannot stop production service. Check Railway CLI configuration."

**Note:** `railway down` removes the most recent deployment — the app stops serving requests. The database is a separate Railway service and continues running. No data is lost — sessions, tokens, and food logs are all in PostgreSQL. Pushing to `release` later creates a new deployment that brings the service back.

If no migration is needed, skip this step — the service stays running during backup and merge.

### 4.4 Dump Production Database

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin/pg_dump "$DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL" \
  --format=custom \
  --no-owner \
  --no-privileges \
  -f _migrations/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).dump
```

Verify the dump file was created and is non-empty:

```bash
ls -lh _migrations/backup-*.dump | tail -1
```

If dump fails, **STOP**: "Database backup failed. Do not proceed without a backup."

Report: "Production backup saved to `_migrations/backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dump` (X KB)"

## Phase 5: Execute Release

### 5.1 Apply Migrations to Production

**Full migration script (Simple complexity):**

If a migration script was written in Phase 3, run it using the URL from Phase 4.2 **before** merging to release (service is already stopped):

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin/psql "$DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL" -f _migrations/release-YYYYMMDD.sql
```

If the migration fails, **STOP**: "Migration failed on production. Service is down. Investigate before proceeding. Backup available at `_migrations/backup-*.dump`. To restore service, push current `release` branch again or redeploy from Railway dashboard."

**Data-only SQL (Data-only complexity):**

If data-only SQL was written in Phase 2.4, run it **after** merging to release and confirming the deploy succeeded (Drizzle migrations must run first at deploy startup). Wait for the Railway deploy to complete, then:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin/psql -d "$DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL" -f _migrations/data-YYYYMMDD.sql
```

If no migrations or data operations are needed, skip this step.

### 5.2 Clear MIGRATIONS.md

Reset `MIGRATIONS.md` to its empty template:

```markdown
# Pending Production Migrations

Log potential production data migrations here during development. These notes are assessed and implemented by the `push-to-production` skill when promoting `main` to `release`.

**Format:** Describe what changed and what data is affected. Simple reference SQL is fine; do not write full migration scripts — those are built at release time.

<!-- Add entries below this line -->
```

### 5.3 Update Version and Changelog

**Determine version** (follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)):

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` and extract the current version from the first `## [x.y.z]` header
2. If `<arguments>` contains a version (e.g., `2.0.0`):
   - Validate it's valid semver (X.Y.Z)
   - Validate it's strictly higher than current version
   - If invalid, **STOP**: "Invalid version. Must be higher than current [current]."
3. If no argument, **deduce the bump from the commits being promoted** (from Phase 1.8):
   - **MAJOR** (`x+1.0.0`): Incompatible/breaking changes — removed or renamed API routes, changed API response shapes, DB schema changes that break existing clients, removed features
   - **MINOR** (`x.y+1.0`): Backward-compatible new functionality — new screens, new API endpoints, new features, significant UI additions
   - **PATCH** (`x.y.z+1`): Backward-compatible bug fixes — bug fixes, UI tweaks, refactoring, performance improvements, documentation, dependency updates
   - When commits span multiple categories, use the **highest** bump level (MAJOR > MINOR > PATCH)
   - Show the user which bump level was chosen and why, so they can override if they disagree

**Write changelog entry** (follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)):

See [references/changelog-guidelines.md](references/changelog-guidelines.md) for the full INCLUDE/EXCLUDE criteria and writing style rules.

**Process:**

1. Review the commit list from Phase 1.7
2. Filter out purely internal changes (they get zero entries)
3. Move any items from the `## [Unreleased]` section into the new version entry
4. Write a `## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry, grouping changes under these section headers (omit empty sections):
   - `### Added` — new features, new screens
   - `### Changed` — changes to existing functionality, UI improvements
   - `### Deprecated` — features that will be removed in a future release
   - `### Removed` — removed features
   - `### Fixed` — bug fixes
   - `### Security` — security-related changes, vulnerability fixes
5. Group minor fixes into single items (e.g., "Minor bug fixes" or "Minor UI polish")
6. Keep each section concise — aim for 3-8 items total across all sections
7. Insert the new entry between `## [Unreleased]` and the previous version (keep Unreleased section empty)
8. Update the comparison links at the bottom of the file:
   - `[Unreleased]` link: compare new version tag to HEAD
   - New version link: compare previous version tag to new version tag
   - Format: `[Unreleased]: https://github.com/lucaswall/food-scanner/compare/vNEW...HEAD`
   - Format: `[NEW]: https://github.com/lucaswall/food-scanner/compare/vOLD...vNEW`

**Update package.json:**

Edit `package.json` to set `"version"` to the new version string.

### 5.4 Commit and Push to Main

Stage and commit all release housekeeping files:

```bash
git add MIGRATIONS.md CHANGELOG.md package.json
git commit -m "release: v<version>"
git push origin main
```

### 5.5 Merge Main to Release

```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
git merge origin/main --no-edit
git push origin release
```

If merge conflicts occur, **STOP** and tell the user to resolve them manually.

**Note:** Pushing to `release` triggers Railway auto-deploy. If the service was stopped in Phase 4.3, the deploy will bring it back up automatically. Drizzle runs at startup, sees the covered migrations already in `__drizzle_migrations`, and skips them.

### 5.6 Tag Release

Create an annotated git tag on the `release` branch and push it:

```bash
git tag -a "v<version>" -m "v<version>"
git push origin "v<version>"
git checkout main
```

## Phase 6: Post-Release

### 6.1 Move Done Issues to Released

Transition all Linear issues in "Done" to "Released" now that the code is live in production.

1. Query all issues in Done state:
   ```
   mcp__linear__list_issues with team: "Food Scanner", state: "Done"
   ```

2. For each issue found, transition to Released using the **state UUID** (both Done and Released are `type: completed` — passing by name could silently no-op):
   ```
   mcp__linear__update_issue with id: <issue-id>, state: "38b7cf14-436a-4c01-9f23-7ffdc42b2009"
   ```

3. Collect the list of moved issues (identifier + title) for the report.

If no issues are in Done, that's fine — skip silently.

If the Linear MCP is unavailable (tools fail), **do not STOP** — log a warning in the report and continue. The release itself succeeded; issue state is cosmetic.

### 6.2 Report

```
## Release Complete

**Version:** X.Y.Z
**Promoted:** main → release
**Commits:** N commits
**Backup:** _migrations/backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dump
**Migration:** [Applied successfully | No migration needed]
**Data operations:** [Applied successfully (list queries) | None]

### Issues Released
[List of FOO-xxx: title moved from Done → Released, or "None"]

### Environment Variable Changes
[List any env var renames/additions from MIGRATIONS.md, or "None"]

### Next Steps
- Monitor Railway deployment at production
- Verify production at https://food.lucaswall.me
- Check Railway deploy logs if issues arise
```

### 6.3 Remind About Env Vars

If MIGRATIONS.md mentioned any environment variable changes, remind the user:

```
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Update these environment variables in Railway production before the deploy completes:
- [OLD_VAR → NEW_VAR]
- [NEW_VAR=value to add]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Not on `main` | STOP — switch to main first |
| Dirty working tree | STOP — commit or stash |
| Behind remote | STOP — pull latest |
| Build/tests fail | STOP — fix before releasing |
| No commits to promote | STOP — nothing to do |
| DB backup fails | STOP — never release without backup |
| Complex migration | STOP — discuss with user |
| Migration SQL fails locally | STOP — fix migration before proceeding |
| Migration fails on production | STOP — service is down, investigate, backup available, restore service with `railway up` |
| Data-only SQL fails on production | Log the error — deploy already succeeded, Drizzle migrations are fine. Report to user and suggest manual fix |
| Cannot stop production service | STOP — check Railway CLI |
| Drizzle internals changed | STOP — read migrator source, update skill before proceeding |
| Merge conflicts | STOP — user resolves manually |
| Railway CLI not available | STOP — install/login Railway CLI |
| pg_dump not found | STOP — `brew install libpq` |
| OrbStack not installed | STOP — `brew install orbstack` |
| OrbStack stopped | Start with `orb start`, then continue |
| Docker Compose db not running | Start with `docker compose up -d`, then continue |
| Invalid/lower version argument | STOP — must be valid semver higher than current |

## Rules

- **Stop service before backup when migrating** — Prevents data loss between backup and migration; backup captures every last write
- **Never skip migration assessment** — Even if MIGRATIONS.md is empty, check the diff
- **Show migration SQL to user** — Always get explicit confirmation before applying
- **Stop → backup → migrate → deploy** — `railway down` stops writes, backup is consistent, migration applies cleanly, push to `release` restarts the service
- **Manual migration covers Drizzle DDL + data + journal** — One atomic script does everything; Drizzle skips already-applied migrations at startup
- **Clear MIGRATIONS.md after release** — Reset to empty template on main
- **No co-author attribution** — Commit messages must NOT include `Co-Authored-By` tags
- **Never force-push** — Use normal merge only
- **Backup files stay local** — `_migrations/` is gitignored
- **Never hardcode user data in SQL** — Derive from existing DB content (SELECT DISTINCT, JOINs), never hardcode emails, names, or personal data
- **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0** — Version bumps follow semver rules: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for bug fixes. Every release gets a CHANGELOG.md entry and matching package.json version
- **Never defer SQL to the user** — All data operations from MIGRATIONS.md must be executed by this skill as part of the release. Never tell the user to run SQL manually post-deploy.
- **Stop on any failure** — Better to abort than corrupt production
