Perform a comprehensive code audit and create Linear issues in Backlog for findings.

## Pre-flight

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** - Load project-specific rules to audit against (if exists)
2. **Query Linear Backlog** - Get existing issues using `mcp__linear__list_issues` with:
   - `team`: "Food Scanner"
   - `state`: "Backlog"
   - For each issue, record: ID, title, labels, priority, description
   - **Audit issues** (labels: Bug, Security, Performance, Convention, Technical Debt) → mark as `pending_validation`
   - **Non-audit issues** (labels: Feature, Improvement) → mark as `preserve` (skip validation)
3. **Read project config** - `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `.gitignore` for structure discovery

## Audit Process

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Audit Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Discover project structure
- [ ] Step 2: Validate existing Linear Backlog issues
- [ ] Step 3: Explore discovered areas systematically
- [ ] Step 4: Check CLAUDE.md compliance
- [ ] Step 5: Check dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Step 6: Merge, deduplicate, and reprioritize
- [ ] Step 7: Create Linear Issues
```

### Step 1: Discover Project Structure

Dynamically discover the project structure (do NOT hardcode paths):

1. **Read configuration files** (in parallel):
   - `tsconfig.json` - check `include`/`exclude` for source patterns
   - `package.json` - check `main`, `types`, `scripts` for entry points
   - `.gitignore` - identify directories to skip

2. **Identify source directories**:
   - Use Glob with patterns from tsconfig.json `include`
   - If no tsconfig, use conventions: `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `packages/`

3. **Map the codebase structure**:
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to understand architecture
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a focus area, prioritize that

### Step 2: Validate Existing Linear Backlog Issues

For each existing issue marked `pending_validation`:

1. **Check if the issue still exists:**
   - Read the referenced file path and line numbers from issue description
   - Verify the problematic code is still present
   - Check git history if needed to see if it was fixed

2. **Classify as `fixed` or `pending`:**

   | Status | Criteria | Action |
   |--------|----------|--------|
   | `fixed` | Code corrected or file removed | Close issue with comment |
   | `pending` | Issue appears to still exist | Carry forward to Step 6 for final classification |

3. **Track validation results** - Log which issues were closed as fixed

Note: Final classification (`still_valid`, `needs_update`, `superseded`) happens in Step 6 after new findings are known.

### Step 3: Systematic Exploration

Use Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to examine each discovered area.

**Look for:**
- Logic errors, null handling, race conditions
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, missing auth, exposed secrets)
- Unhandled edge cases and boundary conditions
- Type safety issues (unsafe casts, unvalidated external data)
- Dead or duplicate code
- Memory leaks (unbounded collections, event listeners, unclosed streams)
- Resource leaks (connections, file handles, timers not cleared)
- Async issues (unhandled promises, missing try/catch)
- Timeout/hang scenarios (API calls without timeouts)
- Graceful shutdown issues (cleanup not performed)

**AI-Generated Code Risks:**
When code shows AI patterns (repetitive structure, unusual APIs), apply extra scrutiny for:
- Logic errors (75% more common in AI code)
- XSS vulnerabilities (2.74x higher frequency)
- Code duplication
- Hallucinated APIs (non-existent methods/libraries)
- Missing business context

See [references/compliance-checklist.md](references/compliance-checklist.md) for detailed checks.

### Step 4: CLAUDE.md Compliance

If CLAUDE.md exists, check project-specific rules defined there (imports, logging, patterns, TDD).

### Step 5: Dependency Vulnerabilities

Run the appropriate audit command:
- **Node.js**: `npm audit` or `yarn audit`
- **Rust**: `cargo audit`
- **Python**: `pip-audit` or `safety check`
- **Go**: `govulncheck`

Include critical/high vulnerabilities in findings.

### Step 6: Merge, Deduplicate, and Reprioritize

Now that you have both `pending` existing issues and new findings, perform final classification:

1. **Classify pending existing issues:**

   | Status | Criteria | Action |
   |--------|----------|--------|
   | `superseded` | New finding covers same issue | Close issue (new finding wins) |
   | `needs_update` | Issue exists but line numbers or severity changed | Update issue description/priority |
   | `still_valid` | Issue unchanged, no overlapping new finding | Keep as-is |

2. **Merge sources:**
   - `still_valid` and `needs_update` existing issues
   - New findings from Steps 3-5

3. **Deduplicate:**
   - Same code location → merge into the one with higher priority

4. **Reassess priorities** for the entire combined list:
   - See [references/priority-assessment.md](references/priority-assessment.md) for impact x likelihood matrix
   - Document priority changes with reason

**For category tags and label mapping, see [references/category-tags.md](references/category-tags.md).**

**For each new finding, prepare:**
- File path and approximate location
- Clear problem description
- Linear label (mapped from category tag)
- Linear priority (1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low)

**Do NOT document solutions.** Identify problems only.

### Step 7: Create Linear Issues

For each new finding, use `mcp__linear__create_issue`:

```
team: "Food Scanner"
state: "Backlog"
title: "[Brief description of the issue]"
description: "[File path]\n\n[Problem description]"
priority: [1|2|3|4] (mapped from critical/high/medium/low)
labels: [Mapped label(s)]
```

**Label Mapping (from category tags):**

| Category Tags | Linear Label |
|---------------|--------------|
| `[security]`, `[dependency]` | Security |
| `[bug]`, `[async]`, `[shutdown]`, `[edge-case]`, `[type]` | Bug |
| `[memory-leak]`, `[resource-leak]`, `[timeout]`, `[rate-limit]` | Performance |
| `[convention]` | Convention |
| `[dead-code]`, `[duplicate]`, `[test]`, `[practice]`, `[docs]`, `[chore]` | Technical Debt |
| `[feature]` | Feature |
| `[improvement]`, `[enhancement]`, `[refactor]` | Improvement |

**Priority Mapping:**
- `[critical]` → 1 (Urgent)
- `[high]` → 2 (High)
- `[medium]` → 3 (Medium)
- `[low]` → 4 (Low)

**Rules:**
- NO solutions in issue descriptions - identify problems only
- Include file paths in description
- One issue per distinct finding

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No tsconfig.json or package.json | Use conventions: `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` |
| npm audit fails | Note skip, continue with code audit |
| CLAUDE.md doesn't exist | Skip project-specific checks |
| Linear Backlog query fails | Continue with fresh audit (no existing issues to validate) |
| No existing Backlog issues | Start fresh (skip validation step) |
| Referenced file no longer exists | Mark issue as `fixed`, close in Linear |
| Cannot determine if issue is fixed | Keep as `still_valid` |
| Explore agent times out | Continue with Glob/Grep |
| Large codebase (>1000 files) | Focus on `$ARGUMENTS` area or entry points |

## Rules

- **Analysis only** - Do NOT modify source code
- **No solutions** - Document problems, not fixes
- **Be thorough** - Check every file in scope
- **Be specific** - Include file paths

## Termination

Output this message and STOP:

```
Audit complete. Findings created as Linear issues in Backlog.

Preserved: P non-audit issues (features, improvements)

Existing Backlog issues:
- A kept (still valid)
- B closed (fixed or superseded)
- C updated (description/priority changed)

New issues created: D

Linear Backlog summary:
- X Urgent/High priority issues
- Y Medium priority issues
- Z Low priority issues

Issue IDs: FOO-N1, FOO-N2, ...

Next step: Review Backlog in Linear and use `plan-todo` to create implementation plans.
```

Do not ask follow-up questions. Do not offer to fix issues.
