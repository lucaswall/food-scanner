# Pending Production Migrations

Log potential production data migrations here during development. These notes are assessed and implemented by the `push-to-production` skill when promoting `main` to `release`.

**Format:** Describe what changed and what data is affected. Simple reference SQL is fine; do not write full migration scripts — those are built at release time.
